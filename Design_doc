                                                                  Design Documetns
                                                                  
                                                                     Approach 1

These are the following steps which are taken to complete the exercise :-

1) First we check the count of the total number of images which is very few, so we need to regenrate the images using DataAugmentation
2) By using ImageDataGenerator we recreated the images by transforming the images and saving into the directory
3) As ratio between good and bad images were about(3:1) so we try to balance the imbalance data by recreating 30 images for bad image and 10 image for good image
4) Then we converted the images dataset into dataframe and label the images as good and bad
5) We divide the dataset into three parts as training, validation and testing
6) Then we reshape the images into a standard size of 128 x 128 
7) We created a CNN model contiaining 3 hidden layer along with max pooling layer
8) Then we use the callback and early_Stopping to regularize the model so that model doen not overfit
9) Then we fit and predicted the upcoming images
