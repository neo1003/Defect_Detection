                                                                  Design Documetns
                                                                  
                                                                     Approach 1

1) First we removed background noise from the images using filters
2) Creating labels for the images into binary classification as good and bad
3) Reshapping the images into standard images (255 x 255)
4) Saving the images into np array
5) Creating new images by transforming earlier images as dataset have low number of images
6) Ratio between good and bad is imbalance (7:1) so recreate images more by transforming bad images to make it balance
7) Create a CNN model
8) Use dropout for regularization
9) Fit model
10) Predict model on the train image dataset
